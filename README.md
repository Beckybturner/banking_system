This banking system uses a separate txt file to record and maintain the user's details.
The system enables users to login or register and to then perform the following tasks:
          1 - Check balance
          2 - Transfer Funds (to another user)
          3 - Deposit money
          4 - Withdraw money
          5 - Change PIN
The txt file is then updated when the user exits the program.

User info: path to the txt file will need to be changed if it's not saved in the same location
